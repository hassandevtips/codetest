Here are some refactoring suggestions for The BookingRepository:

1:- Organize your import statements at the top of the file for better readability.
2:- Consider using dependency injection in the constructor, which can make your code more testable. Pass in the dependencies (Job model and MailerInterface) rather than instantiating them inside the constructor.
3:- Move the logger setup to a separate method or a dedicated LoggerFactory class to encapsulate the setup logic and improve maintainability.
4:- Use more descriptive variable names like $normalJobs instead of $noramlJobs for better clarity.
5:- Avoid using array() for array initialization. You can use [] for cleaner syntax.
6:- Consider using the collect function to transform and sort the collection of normal jobs instead of using foreach.
7:- Variable naming: Use consistent variable names like $normalJobs instead of $noramlJobs.
8:- Use the ternary operator for conditional assignment to make the code more concise and readable.
9:- Consider moving the logic inside the if and elseif blocks to separate methods for better organization and readability.
10:- Use associative arrays with meaningful keys when returning data from functions to improve code clarity.
11:- The function first attempts to find the job based on the provided job ID. If the job is not found, it returns a "fail" response with a relevant message.
12:- The use of null coalescing operators (??) is applied to provide default values when necessary.
13:- The code related to updating job properties and sending an email is more structured and easier to read.
14:- I've extracted the email sending logic into a separate private function sendJobCreatedEmail to improve code organization and readability.
15:- Error handling is done for the case when the job is not found, providing a "fail" response with a relevant message.


Here are some refactoring suggestions for The BookingController:


1:- Removed unnecessary use statements and rearranged the remaining ones.
2:- Improved the readability of the code by simplifying logic and handling nullable values better.
3:- Standardized variable assignments for $distance, $time, $jobid, $session, $flagged, $manually_handled, $by_admin, and $admincomment.
4:- Used null coalescing operator (??) for handling optional values.
5:- Simplified conditions for 'flagged', 'manually_handled', and 'by_admin' based on boolean values.
6:- Removed commented-out code.
7:- Made the code cleaner and more organized.
8:- These changes should improve the code's maintainability and readability.
